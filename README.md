# Python
When a user uses a bank management system, there are 3 options displayed on screen,
there is log in, create a new account and exit. Users must login first to use the services if the
user doesn't have an account number, please choose option 2 to create a new account. To
create a new bank account, the user must enter his/her first name, surname, age, phone
number, funds, and password then system assign IBAN and account number for the user.
After that, the user can use the bank system to deposit, withdraw, transfer it to other account,
check balance, check transaction record, open saving account, and open checking account.
However, the savings account could be opened by anybody older than 14 but users must
know that if they open a saving account that only allows one withdrawal or one transfer in one
month. If a user opens a checking account that only allows users who are 18 years or older
and this account allows the user to have a maximum - â‚¬50 negative balance in a bank account
as credit account. Otherwise, if the user already has a bank account, please choose option
one and login using and password. After that the user can use all the bank services in the
bank system. If the user does not want to use any other service they need to logout of their
current logged in account. As a result, somebody else or the same user can login using
another account number and password. If no further use of the system is noticed than the
entire system can be shut down using the third option in the main i.e, Exit
As the checking and savings account and the child classes of parent class account it
allows us to use the parents class functions using dot operator.
